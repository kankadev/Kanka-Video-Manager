# Kanka Video Manager

Kanka Video Manager allows you to easily sort or sort out media files. We use this program to quickly view, move and delete surveillance videos - even in Windows.

As a base Kanka Video Manager uses vlc / [vlcj](https://github.com/caprica/vlcj) and is developed using Java/JavaFX.

The program is currently under development, so some important features are not yet available.
